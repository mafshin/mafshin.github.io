# Response 1
Create a detailed digital illustration depicting a traditional Iranian Sangak bakery from approximately 40 years ago. The scene shows a baker using a long steel wand to place a carefully shaped bread dough, represented as a vibrant 3D "prompt," into a large, fiery traditional Sangak oven. The outer wall of this oven is uniquely decorated with square tiles, each randomly displaying logos of prominent AI models such as SuperGrok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

The bakery is bustling with diverse customers waiting patiently in two clearly defined lines. Among them are humans, robots, and cyborgs, all harmoniously coexisting. Above the right queue, designated for customers purchasing three or more breads, hangs a small wooden signboard displaying the Persian phrase "سه تایی". Above the left queue, intended for customers buying only one bread, is another wooden signboard clearly labeled "یکی".

The bakery interior has a nostalgic, vintage ambiance reflecting Iran from four decades past, featuring rustic equipment, aged wooden shelves, and traditional bakery tools. A large, slightly weathered signboard on the right wall reads "@AIHeartbeat," partially faded but still legible, adding to the authentic aged atmosphere.

The viewpoint is from the top-left corner, capturing the entire bakery, including the baker at work, customers in both queues, machinery, and the uniquely tiled oven wall. The visual style should evoke warm, nostalgic tones with detailed textures and culturally accurate aesthetics.
