# **Flow Efficiency**

*   **Definition**
    *   **Quantifies the proportion of time spent actively working on a task relative to the total time it takes for that task to traverse the entire process** [1]
    *   **Highlights how much of the total elapsed time is truly dedicated to adding value, as opposed to time spent waiting, being blocked, or in other non-productive states** [1]
    *   Example: Software feature (2 days active work / 10 days total) = 20% flow efficiency [1, 2]

*   **Underlying Principles**
    *   **Linked to Lean philosophy, emphasizing the elimination of waste ("Muda") and smooth flow** [2, 3]
    *   Views any time a work item is not being actively worked on as waste [2]
    *   Aligns with **flow thinking**, optimizing the entire system, not just individual tasks [2, 4]
    *   Includes **managing Work in Progress (WIP) to prevent bottlenecks** [2]
    *   Ensuring a **steady and predictable movement of work** through the value stream [2]
    *   Examining the two fundamental components of **lead time**: active working time and waiting time [2, 5]

*   **Calculating Flow Efficiency**
    *   Formula: **Flow Efficiency (%) = (Value-Adding Time / Total Time) Ã— 100** [2, 7]
    *   **Value-Adding Time**: Cumulative time spent actively working on a task [7, 21]
    *   **Total Time**: Usually **Lead Time** (initiation to delivery) [7, 21] or sometimes **Cycle Time** (start of active work to completion) [7, 8]
    *   Accurate calculation requires meticulous tracking of both active work and overall duration [8]
    *   A flow efficiency around 15% is considered "normal" in some knowledge work environments [5, 8]

*   **Measurement and Tracking in Practice**
    *   Requires a **systematic approach**, often starting with **visualizing the workflow** (e.g., Kanban boards) [1, 9]
    *   Clear identification of **queue or waiting states** [2, 9]
    *   Tools and Techniques:
        *   **Kanban boards**: visual flow, identify bottlenecks [1, 10]
        *   **Cumulative Flow Diagrams (CFDs)**: flow over time, reveal bottlenecks [2, 10]
        *   **Flow Efficiency charts**: track efficiency of individual items and averages [1, 10]
        *   Project management software (Businessmap, Plandek, Nave, ClickUp) [2, 10]
    *   Start with a simpler approach and increase granularity if necessary [5, 10]

*   **Common Bottlenecks and Factors that Negatively Impact Flow Efficiency**
    *   **Excessive Work in Progress (WIP)** leads to context switching [2, 11]
    *   **Waiting times** due to dependencies, lack of resources, lengthy approvals, idle tasks [1, 12]
    *   **Blockers** (technical issues, lack of information) prevent progress [1, 12]
    *   Absence of **clear or efficient processes and policies** [1, 13]
    *   Ineffective management of **dependencies** [5, 13]
    *   **Overutilization of resources** can create bottlenecks [12, 13]
    *   These negative factors are often interconnected [13]

*   **Compare and Contrast Flow Efficiency with Other Related Concepts**
    *   **Cycle Time**
        *   Time to complete one unit of work from start of active work to completion [22, 23]
        *   Focuses on active processing efficiency [22]
        *   Flow Efficiency is broader, including waiting time [11, 22]

        *   Total time from request initiation to fulfillment [21, 24]
        *   Flow Efficiency = Value-Adding Time / Lead Time [5, 24]
        *   Low flow efficiency indicates high non-value-adding components in lead time [24]
    *   **Utilization**
        *   Extent to which resources are being used productively [19, 24]

        *   Flow Efficiency focuses on process efficiency (speed of work) [19, 24]
        *   Optimizing for high utilization can lower flow efficiency (bottlenecks) [24, 25]
        *   Optimizing for flow may involve accepting some resource slack [24]
